# Apollo SM write/read speed tests
Speed testing the apollo service module by reading and writing to scratch.
The teststand test SM speed using getNode, readRegister, and UIO direct respectively.
The other speedtest uses UIO direct to test read and write/read.
## Build/Installation
To build the teststand, use:
```
git clone git@github.com:ablaizot/speedtest.git
make
```

## Command Module Tests

Powerup the command module using BUTool.
```
BUTool.exe -a --cmd cmpwrup
```
Unload the previous firmware if loaded and load in the new firmware. Load the latest tarball from the block_ram branch the it-dtc FW [repo](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-tracker-phase2-data-processing/BE_firmware/inner-tracker-dtc/inner-tracker-dtc/-/tree/block_ram?ref_type=heads) with the following commands. 

```
uio_send.py list-devices
uio_send.py unload-tar -u {uidF1}
uio_send.py unload-tar -u {uidF2}
uio_send.py program-fpga -f {F1_tarball}.tgz
uio_send.py program-fpga -f {F1_tarball}.tgz
```

## Running

### Allowed Commands

Syntax: ./test_stand -c cmd
   cmd = 1 uhal (getNode) speedtest
   cmd = 2 uhal (getRegister) speedtest"
   cmd = 3 UIO Direct speedtest
   cmd = 4 UIO Direct mock map speedtest
   cmd = 5 UIO Direct bus error speedtest
   cmd = 6 EMP (Single Read/write) speedtest
   cmd = 7 EMP (Block Read/write) speedtest

Example command

Run the test stand with the following command:
`./test_stand -c 7 -n payload.block_ram1.MEM --block_size 16384 -l 100`

The maximum block size is 262144, though some FW will have smaller BRAMS, allowing only for smaller transfers.

```
Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]                         produce help message
  -c [ --command ] arg                  select command to run
  -s [ --stop ] arg (=1)                set to false to let it run until SIGINT
  -i [ --list_commands ]                list available commands
  -a [ --connections_file ] arg (=/opt/address_table/connections.xml)
                                        full path to connections file
  -b [ --emp_connections_file ] arg (=/opt/address_table/emp_connections.xml)
                                        full path to connections file
  -f [ --fpga ] arg (=1)                fpga number
  -k [ --block_size ] arg (=100)        block size for block read/write
                                        speedtest
  -l [ --loops ] arg (=1000000)         number of loops for speedtest
  -u [ --uio_address_str ] arg (=0x000007F0)
                                        uio address from top node
  -n [ --node ] arg (=PL_MEM.SCRATCH.WORD_00)
                                        node for speedtests
  -w [ --write_only ] arg (=0)          set to true to only write to node
```
## Sweep
Run `nohup python3 script.py &` to sweep the different BRAMS with different block sizes

## Bit Error Test

To run in the background until stopped:
`./test_stand -c 7 -n payload.block_ram1.MEM --block_size 65536 -s false > error_test.log &`
